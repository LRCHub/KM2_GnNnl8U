Join the club to fight the scene
You're choking on the words of bands you don't believe
Leave the left and join the right
Replace the mediocrity with those who fight
Fight the good fight

Lift up your hearts!
And you will see the fruits of those who strive accordingly
Lift up your hearts!

The lackluster play hide and seek
The faithful share the truth of Christianity
Why don't you see?
Are they ashamed to bear the name
When all the while they fool themselves
With fake acclaim they never get
