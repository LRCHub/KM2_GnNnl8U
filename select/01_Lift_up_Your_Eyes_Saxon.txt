Light of light eternal hope has come
By and by to lead us back to love
Come behold the manger for a bed
Where the King of kings has laid his head
Light of lights, eternal hope has come

Hear the angels song break the silent night
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes, see the Saving One born that none may die
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
Glory to God, let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes, glory to God, let the Earth reply
Lift up your eyes

Come and lay your offering at his feet
Where the sons of earth and heavens meet
Let the joy awake in every heart
Born into the night, the morning star
Come and lay your offering at his feet

Hear the angels song break the silent night
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes, see the Saving One born that none may die
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
Glory to God, let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes, glory to God, let the Earth reply
Lift up your eyes

He shall be called Wonderful
Counselor, Almighty God
He shall be called Prince of Peace
The Lord of Hosts, the hope for us

Can you hear the angels song break the silent night?
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes, see the Saving One born that none may die
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
Glory to God, let the praises rise
Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes, glory to God, let the Earth reply
Lift up your eyes, yeah

Glory, glory (lift up your eyes)
Gonna lift my eyes (lift up your eyes)
Lift my eyes, glory (glory to God, let the earth reply)
To our God, to our King (lift up your eyes)
We lift up our eyes (lift up your eyes)
