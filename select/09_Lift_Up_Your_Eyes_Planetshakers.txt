Angels passing around me
Here I stand in awe of Your beauty
Captured by Your holiness

I see heaven before me
Angels passing around me
Here I stand in awe of Your beauty
Captured by Your holiness

Lift up Your eyes
All of heaven's in worship
Angels rejoice and the clouds will be filled
With the wonder of Your name
With the wonder of Your name
The train of His robe fills the temple with glory
Heavenly hosts fall before Him in worship
Crying Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty
