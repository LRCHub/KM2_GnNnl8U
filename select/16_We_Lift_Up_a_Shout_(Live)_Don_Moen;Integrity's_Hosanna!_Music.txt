We march to the tune of a love song
Singing the king's jubilee
Anointed to enter the hell gate
Anointed to set captives free

We lift up our banner of worship
And Jesus our champion we praise
An army of worshipers stands by his side
Baptized in his fire revealing his glorious light

We lift up a shout
A victory shout
For we've overcome by the blood of the lamb
And the word of our mouth
And we declared war
In the name of the Lord
We've laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the Earth

We sing the high praises of Heaven
And fight with the sword of the word
To bind every stronghold of Satan
Preparing the way of the Lord
We lift up a standard of worship
That shatters the darkness with light

And God will arise
On the wings of our praise
And march as a warrior
Who's mighty and able to save
(He's mighty to save)

We lift up a shout
A victory shout
For we've overcome by the blood of the lamb
And the word of our mouth
And we declared war
In the name of the Lord
We've laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the Earth

We lift up a shout
We lift up a shout
A victory shout
For we've overcome by the blood of the lamb
And the word of our mouth
(We declared war) we declared war
(Yes) in the name of the Lord
(In Jesus name) we've laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the Earth

We've laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the Earth (hallelujah)
Yes, yes shout to God with the voice of triumph
Let's lift up his name throughout all the Earth
We lift up a shout

We lift up a shout
A victory shout
For we've overcome by the blood of the lamb
And the word of our mouth
And we declared war, yes
In the name of the Lord (in Jesus name)
We've laid down our lives

That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the Earth
We've laid down our lives
That the triumph of Christ
May resound in the Earth

Yes, we shout to you God
With a voice of triumph
We shout to you Lord
Glory, glory to God
Jesus, glory to God (Jesus)
We shout to you with a voice of triumph

Yes, Jesus
We worship you
Thank you Lord
Thank you Lord
Thank you Lord
Lord thank you
